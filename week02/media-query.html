                And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and
                supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I
                did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.

            <p>
                And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of
                God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his
                shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have
                no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which
                ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
