                    Hello! My name is Kathleen, and I go by Kat.
                    I am a Canadian student at BYU-Idaho, studying Software
                    Development. I grew up in the world of Neopets and other
                    browser and PC games, including WarCraft II, Minesweep,
                    and Tamagotchi generations now unknown to most of today's
                    youth. I have always dreamed of working for a team of like-minded
                    people and I'm excited to explore the possibility of that as I
                    pursue my studies.

                    Ontario is a heavily populated province in Canada.
                    It is home to 14.6 million people, many of whom live in
                    large and well-known cities like Toronto. While there are no mountains
                    in the province itself, there are plenty of ski slopes to tear down
                    come the winter months. While Canada is known for its harsh winters,
                    Ontario is beautiful and vibrant in every season, and the plentiful beaches
                    make even summer a wildly fun time to spend there.
