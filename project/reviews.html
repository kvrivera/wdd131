            *SPOILERS AHEAD*

        <p>
            ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover‚Äù is the kind of phrase
            I laugh at as I pick up aesthetically intriguing books like this one, bring them home from la biblioteca and
            love the heck out of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I get the meaning of the phrase in the ways it applies to not judging people.
        </p>
        <p>
            But books? You bet I‚Äôm judging them based on their cover. And the publishers know I am. They‚Äôre actively
            creating covers for their very purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it‚Äôs fine.
        </p>
        This one paid off.
        <p>


            Written from the perspective of Eddie‚Äôs infant sister, who died in infancy of SIDS, this is a heartbreaking
            story of a family whose pain and loss have been too much to bear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flipping between the intimate narrative of her family member‚Äôs lives, to the unique perspective of Isaura,
            written as if speaking directly to another character, we witness the enduring theme of loss that all
            mother‚Äôs
            must experience. Isaura and her daughter Mivi have become inseparably connected to Eddie‚Äôs family, the webs
            of
            their heartache and loss holding one another tightly to each other and proving to be a healing connection.
        </p>
        <p>

            The prose of each paragraph rests on my mind like morning dew. Gentle and light enough to read like a story,
            but
            deep and heavy, piercing even, enough to straighten your back and make you gasp for air. The pain that
            Stainsby
            weaves into the story is so real, so heartbreakingly real, begging to be held, to be felt, to be heard.
            There
            was emotional depth that this offered me as the reader, regardless of my own life experiences. Empathy was a
            gift she etched into heartfelt prose and packaged in a novel. I do think that my own loss and pain as a
            mother
            offered me a depth of connection to Rosy, Isaura and Mivi, weaving the bond of motherhood across years of
            storytelling and cultural and familial history, whether fictional or not.
        </p>
        <p>

            It has been months since I have finished this book now, but yet the theme that has stuck with me since
            closing
            the final pages is that motherhood, and parenthood, is a bond that requires a sacrifice greater than we can
            bear
            alone. There is loss, whether it be the loss of a precious life, or the loss of the life we thought we knew,
            or
            any other number of losses that tear us from who we were, and plant us in the starkly different, frightening
            new
            territory that is the ‚Äúus‚Äù of today. Rosy tried to endure her pain by herself, for decades. She and grief
            became
            so well acquainted that they were interchangeable except by name, and yet what felt like a lifetime of
            knowing
            pain over losing her precious daughter to SIDS left her still grieving, a shell of a person. The monumental
            moments of healing beginning in her heart began as she experienced the thaw granted by her friendship with
            Isaura. Sharing their mutual understanding of pain and loss steadied both of their hearts and gave them both
            a
            lifeline in the seas they were navigating alone. This gave Rosy courage to reach out to her husband and son,
            two
            other precious souls who were also lost at sea for all of those years since their baby‚Äôs death. Maybe they
            could
            make it through this, but only if they banded together.
        </p>
        <p>
            That‚Äôs the lesson I took from this heart-rending story.
        </p>
        <p>

            That no matter how deep I am in the trenches of my own experiences, there is always room for someone else to
            share in the experience with me. Whether it be motherhood or any other number of human experiences, there is
            nothing that we are meant to face entirely alone.
        </p>
        <p>

            This book was moving and emotionally mature, with writing like poetry. I‚Äôm so grateful this story fell into
            my
            lap and touched me so deeply.
        </p>
        <p>

            Who can be your lifeline today?

            I love the smell of old books, an olde font and soft
            cornered pages worn from frequent reading and
            referencing from a loved book‚Äôs pages. I love books!
            And now you have found the one place where I can talk
            freely and wildly about it all.
