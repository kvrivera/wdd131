                "In books I have traveled, not only to other worlds, but
                into my own. I learned who I was and who I wanted to be,
                what I might aspire to, and what I might dare to dream
                about my world and myself. [...] There was waking, and there
                was sleeping. And then there were books, a kind of parallel
                universe in which anything might happen and frequently did,
                a universe in which I might be a newcomer but was never really
                a stranger. My real, true world. My perfect island."

                    Hello, my name is Kat and I am an avid (read: passionately excited)
                    reader. I have been since I figured out how to piece letters together
                    on a page to sound out words and tell stories that someone had neatly
                    packed away for me in the storybooks of my school's library. Worlds
                    without end! How could one walk past a book without wondering what great
                    discoveries lay between the covers and beyond the weathering yellowed
                    pages and blotted text! How can I not love reading? What is there not to
                    love?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here is my little corner of the internet! A place where I can talk about
                    all of the books I have found a home in, and the books I have held hands with
                    for a small walk, and even and especially the books that I have thrown
                    across the room in disgust, contempt, or sheer excitement!!!!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this sort of stuff doesn't excite you, then I fear you may find yourself
                    exquisitely bored flipping through the figurative pages of the corner of my
                    brain that houses my library of read-adventures. In which case I woudl recommend
                    you skip along and find something more (read: something less, far far less)
                    exciting to mull over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to go on this adventure with you, whoever you are reading this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your bookish pal,
                </p>

            I love the smell of old books, an olde font and soft
            cornered pages worn from frequent reading and
            referencing from a loved bookâ€™s pages. I love books!
            And now you have found the one place where I can talk
            freely and wildly about it all.
