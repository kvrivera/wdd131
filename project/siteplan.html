            <p>
                As outlined in the purpose of this project (below), the
                goal in creating this website is to <i>share</i> my favourite
                books that have graced my shelves, both figuratively (through
                public library use), as well as literally (books I actually own).
                Through this project I hope to "share" my shelves, which is what
                inspired the name.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Site Purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
                This website provides a home for book recommendations and reviews
                for books that the site author (Kathleen) has read.

            <h2>
                Scenarios
            </h2>
            <p>
                Someone new to a genre of literature is looking for recommendations to
                start their reading journey off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone looking for books of a specific nature (eg: BIPOC characters,
                strong female lead) or tropes (eg: love triangle) that come highly
                recommended, or books to steer clear of.
            </p>
            <p>
                A parent looking for storybooks for their child, which
                address specific scenarios or situations (eg: first day of school,
                death of a loved one, etc.).
