                become comfortable with a book, not daunted. Books shouldn’t
                be daunting, they should be funny, exciting and wonderful; and
                learning to be a reader gives a terrific advantage.”

            <h3>
                5/5
            </h3>
            <p>
                I love it, I would definitely recommend it, I would probably read
                it again (this doesn’t usually happen btw). Books like these had
                fantastic writing, engaging plot devices carried out with skill,
                master use of suspense and so on. A 5-star book had me living in
                the world, high-fiving heroes, galloping horseback on adventure
                through a forest, cheering on misunderstood villains and probably
                throwing a book across the room various times (shock, excitement,
                what have you).

            <h3>
                4/5
            </h3>
            <p>
                I liked it, I’m not sure I would read it again, I would recommend
                it based on the person. Probably the writing was well-done but
                there was something lacking (or too much) in the story. A book might
                get a 4 star rating if I enjoyed it/was impressed by it,
                but say it didn’t have full resolution (when that isn’t a plot
                device/intentional). Or a storyline that suddenly resolves itself
                far too quickly after drawing out for a while, or a story that was
                well-written but had some loopholes that I think can be overlooked
                for how good the rest of the book is. A 4-star book was great enough
                to (almost completely but not quite) ignore its weaknesses.

            <h3>
                3/3
            </h3>
            <p>
                It was a book, for sure. I felt meh about it. I probably wouldn’t
                recommend it unless someone really liked this sort of book – then I’d
                recommend it entirely for them and I’d preface it by saying it really
                wasn’t fireworks for me haha. It could be a mediocre read that had a
                quality trope that was still enjoyable yet probably very predictable
                and unoriginal, or despite writing that wasn’t very engaging the story
                may have had quality lessons or “moral of the story” moments that are
                worth reading the book for.

            <h3>
                2/5
            </h3>
            <p>
                Boring, wouldn’t read it again and wouldn’t recommend it. This is a
                book that probably feels “copy and paste” from other books, one of
                those “I’ve read this before but it wasn’t this book,” kind of books.
                Boring plot, or a brilliant plot that’s delivered in such a boring way
                that even action and excitement and top-notch romantic tension suddenly
                feels like… well, like a yawn. If it’s a 2 star, I’m really not
                impressed and I might feel like this was a waste of my time. But
                the key here is that I still made it to the end of the book. I
                finished it.

            <p>
                I didn’t even finish the book. So … yeah, 1 star.
